    <h1>1.01111 Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      This project proposal is for the travel agency app named TripFellas. In
      this proposal, a project description of the application will be made,
      following the reasons why a database is needed and how it will be used as
      a part of the application. After that, the functional requirements will be
      listed, as it is an obligatory step in designing a system. Then,
      non-functional requirements will be listed to clearly define the systemâ€™s
      priorities in terms of non-functional requirements. In the following
      section, Limitations will be shown to define the boundaries of the system.
      Lastly, it will be finished by providing an Entity-Relationship model of
      the application our group is planning to realize.
    </p>

    <h1>2.0 Project Description</h1>
    <p>
      TripFellas is planned to be a travel agency website, featuring booking
      hotels and tours and reviewing them. It is intended to be used by the
      people who are traveling, hotel managers, guides, and tour companies. It
      will have similar features to TripAdvisor, which is a widely-used travel
      agency website.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Customers using this app can browse tours and hotels within a location,
      book hotel rooms, and make reservations for tours with several activities
      (such as sightseeing and extra activities) and guides. They can also make
      TripBuddies(TM) and comment on their profiles. Most importantly, they can
      give feedback to the tour, hotel, and tour guide, which all other users
      can see of the system.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      TripFellas will feature guides, which are assigned to tours and guide the
      travelers on tour. Guides are given the freedom of accepting or declining
      an assignment about a tour, and after guiding a tour, they will also
      provide feedback for the tour like the customers.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Another user is TripFellas employees. They can assign guides to tours and
      make reservations or update reservation details for the customers.
    </p>

    <h1>3.0 Why/How a Database Is Needed</h1>
    <p>
      In this application, using a database is obligatory as persistent data
      management will be needed to provide the information entered by another
      user or the same user in a past time. For example, all users should have
      their accounts that persist after it is created, whose authentication
      details like password and username should be stored in a database.
      Moreover, the system will continuously fetch data entered by other users.
      Using a database will enable developers to fetch this data with ease.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The database will be used via a storage engine, which will have its
      methods for querying using SQL and JavaScript. This will enable a smooth
      transition between the user and the database, making the user feel
      optimized and fast.
    </p>

    <h1>4.0 Requirements</h1>
    <p>
      This section explains the functional and non-functional requirements for
      our website.
    </p>

    <h2>4.1 Functional Requirements</h2>

    <h3>4.1.1 Signup & Login</h3>
    <p>
      Like many websites, TripFellas will have both signup and login
      functionalities. Users signing up to the website can choose if they are a
      traveler that searches for hotels and tours, a guide that guides customers
      in the tour, a tour or a hotel employee, and sign up with that role. After
      signing up, the users can log in with their chosen credentials and use the
      website based on their role.
    </p>

    <h3>4.1.2 Booking a Hotel & Making Reservation for a Tour</h3>
    <p>
      Because TripFellas is a travel agency app, booking and reserving
      functionalities are critical. While tour and hotel employees must be able
      to choose the limitations of the capacity, dates, and other details of the
      tour/hotel, customers should make these operations by themselves.
      Additionally, employees must be able to create a reservation or update an
      existing reservation to help the customers who cannot reserve or book as
      they want.
    </p>
