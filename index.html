<h1>1.01111 Introduction</h1>
<p>This project proposal is for the travel agency app named TripFellas. In this proposal, a project description of the application will be made, following the reasons why a database is needed and how it will be used as a part of the application. After that, the functional requirements will be listed, as it is an obligatory step in designing a system. Then, non-functional requirements will be listed to clearly define the systemâ€™s priorities in terms of non-functional requirements. In the following section, Limitations will be shown to define the boundaries of the system. Lastly, it will be finished by providing an Entity-Relationship model of the application our group is planning to realize.

<h1>2.0 Project Description</h1>
<p>TripFellas is planned to be a travel agency website, featuring booking hotels and tours and reviewing them. It is intended to be used by the people who are traveling, hotel managers, guides, and tour companies. It will have similar features to TripAdvisor, which is a widely-used travel agency website.
 
  Customers using this app can browse tours and hotels within a location, book hotel rooms, and make reservations for tours with several activities (such as sightseeing and extra activities) and guides. They can also make TripBuddies(TM) and comment on their profiles. Most importantly, they can give feedback to the tour, hotel, and tour guide, which all other users can see of the system.

  TripFellas will feature guides, which are assigned to tours and guide the travelers on tour. Guides are given the freedom of accepting or declining an assignment about a tour, and after guiding a tour, they will also provide feedback for the tour like the customers.

  Another user is TripFellas employees. They can assign guides to tours and make reservations or update reservation details for the customers.
